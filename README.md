# Visualization_F1

## Main idea

The main goal would be to visualize the unnecessary travel that F1 teams currently make during a world championship season. For instance, the calendar sometimes sends teams from Saudi Arabia to Miami and then back to Europe, which creates a lot of back-and-forth movement.

In this project, we could:
- Map the current calendar using the geographic coordinates of each circuit.


- Quantify travel distances between races, showing the total movement required.


- Estimate environmental impact by combining distance with average logistics data from sustainability reports (e.g., air freight emissions). The estimates may not be perfect, but they can illustrate the scale of the issue.


- Propose an optimized calendar by reordering the races to minimize total travel distance. Using a simple proportional model, we could then compare the environmental impact of the optimized route against the actual one.

## Extra-idea

Game interactive map, in order to obtain the least environmental impact.

## Main steps

1. Find a lot of data about (championship logistics, travel solution , …)

2. Define a database structure and technology (Relational DB, Spatial DB , Time series DB)

3. Decide which type of visualization we want to create.

4. Create a Demo (using HTML,CSS,...)

5. Start to implement the final application/website.

## INFORMATION

Championship information:
Logistics overview : F1 logistics involve moving cars, equipment, and staff across five continents using cargo planes, ships, and trucks, making it one of the most complex operations in sport. 

Calendar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Formula_One_World_Championship


Logistics specification: https://f1destinations.com/the-logistics-of-formula-1/
Main partner : DHL
50 tons of cargo estimated 
DHL cargo travels upwards of 130,000km over the course of a season, in up to six or seven Boeing 747 cargo planes per event.
Up to 300 trucks head from race to race. If you put them all together, they’d make a convoy longer than 5km!
Over a season, teams ship 660 tons of air freight and 500 tons of sea freight (the equivalent of 165 elephants, if that’s your preferred scale of measurement).
The cargo crates are specially designed to effectively fill all the space available in DHL’s planes.
There’s around 100 people involved in the logistics overall, including people from DHL, team personnel and locals to each event who aid the operation.
Each team has around three pallets worth of priority cargo. This will be the first cargo that arrives at the circuit, allowing teams to begin setting up their cars and garages. It’s up to the teams what equipment goes in these pallets.
